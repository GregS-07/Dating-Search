## Running

Make sure python is installed.

In order to run this application locally, certain libraries need installing and the database needs to be created.
Run this inside the directory of this project folder:

```bash
pip install Flask matplotlib pandas
```

Once these are installed successfully, run this command to create the graphs (it also creates the database and other stuff but it is already in the folder):

```bash
python database.py
```

Run this command and open the link provided in the terminal

```bash
python app.py
```
## Purpose

This was created during my internship at SimpleClick as a technical task given for presentation and review.
